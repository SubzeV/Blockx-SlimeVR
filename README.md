# Please note!
I have made a new case that is way more user friendly and works better, you can find it here: https://github.com/SubzeV/VertexArmor-Enclosure

This case was my first and will still be available, but I don't recommend to use it as the lid easily falls off and the general tolerances are fine but not optimal.

# Blockx SlimeVR case
Blockx is a case for SlimeVR built from the ground up with the intention of making a strong and easy to print case while also being easy to use and taking up as little space as possible. This is my first SlimeVR case and it might not be perfect for everyone.

Component support:
* BMI160
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 Battery
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26AWG wires (extra tall version of these cases prefered for thicker wires)

For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

All files were printed sucesfully with both the Creality Slicer, PrusaSlicer and SuperSlicer on a stock Ender 3 v2.

These cases are and will stay a W.I.P. for a little while.

The battery is supposed to sit underneeth all the components which you can mount on the provided insert using some (hot) glue.
