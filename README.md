# Blockx SlimeVR case
Blockx is a case for SlimeVR built from the ground up with the intention of making a strong and easy to print case while also being easy to use and taking up as little space as possible. This is my first SlimeVR case and this is the first revision, it might not be perfect for everyone.

Component support:
* BMI160
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 Battery
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 26AWG wires

Made with Blender 3.4

Still a W.I.P.
Extensions will be added later and little tweaks will happen
