# Blockx SlimeVR case
Blockx is a case for SlimeVR built from the ground up with the intention of making a strong and easy to print case while also being easy to use and taking up as little space as possible. This is my first SlimeVR case and it might not be perfect for everyone.

Component support:
* BMI160
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 Battery
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26AWG wires (extra tall version of these cases prefered for thicker wires)

For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

Made with Blender 3.4.1 and 3.5

I have printed most of the files except for the lids 6 through 9.
All were printed sucesfully with both the Creality Slicer 4.8.2, PrusaSlicer latest and SuperSlicer 2.4 on a pretty much stock Ender 3 v2.

These cases are and will stay a W.I.P. for a little while.

The battery is supposed to sit underneeth all the components which you can mount on the provided insert using some (hot) glue.

Extensions will be added later and little tweaks will happen over time
